Melvin Peepers’s User Manual - Communicating with me

## What are your primary goals as a human being?

- Choose empowering thoughts and statements to create my best life.
- To stop putting my limitations on other people.

## What do you want  us to know about your communication style?

- I’m very visual, and I like to refer back to communication, so written is my preferred communication style.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- I can be quiet at first, but once I get to know you, you can find me talking a lot.
- I like knowing the itty bitty details when talking about technical products or features. I also like having time to use products and features (not just reading or hearing about them) before forming solid opinions.
- I work best in small groups and with people I know.

## How can you best work with me?

- Placeholder- Let me know when I make mistakes, or if I’m otherwise not doing what I should be doing. Generally, if I’m not doing something that’s expected, it’s because I don’t know, or I misunderstood the expectation. 
- Mentioned above, but I like details written down or documented so I can refer to them when I inevitable forget or lose focus.
- I make a lot of list or checklist so I don’t miss important things.

## What are your pet peeves?

- Mean, rude people. 
- Not knowing, I don’t need to know everything, but I like knowing everything I can about what I do or work on, if I’m making mistakes or missing things, I like to know so I can come up with a plan/way to fix things.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- I can be slow at opening up.
- If I don’t start right away, I can instead start to procrastinate.
- Being aware of what’s going on outside of my immediate field of vision.
